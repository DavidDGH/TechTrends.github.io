<article id="Digital Identity">
<b><h2 class="Header">Digital Identity </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">Digital Identity is when someone steals your personal information to try and 
scam you. Their main goal is to get money and drain your bank account. Some benifits 
of Digital Identity include the ability to enablefrictionless interactions with 
public and private institutions. Also, it allows businesses to confirm the 
identity of individuals for sensitive transactions, such as Banking and Healthcare. 
Some of the consequences of Digital Identity, on the other hand, 
may include Identity Theft, Cyberbullying, and Online Harassment. 
On top of this, if a person is affected by a security breach, an individual 
may suffer a personal attack – comparable to real life. Some componets of 
technology that is required for this trend to fully work properly include Facial 
Recognition, Fingerprints, Usernames, Passwords, and Biometric markers. There are 
many jobs that use Digital Identity in their everyday lives, and those can include 
Staff Data Scientist, Senior Digital Identity Analyst, Senior IT Security 
Professional, Staff Data Engineer, etc. One of the websites that can help people 
understand Digital Identity is Digital Identity Technology – United States Agency 
for International Development (.gov) This website is

<article id="AI">
<b><h2 class="Header">AI </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">AI, also known as Artificial Inteligence is the ability of a computer or robot 
controlled by a computer to do tasks usually done by humans. Some benifits include 
coding and programing the robots/computers to do things that you need to do so you 
don’t need to do it. There are many diverse concerns regarding AI Technology, 
ranging from Lack of transparency and privacy to Ethical Dilemmas and Job 
displacement. Some AI components are Speech recognition, Computer vision, and 
Natural Language Processing. Some careers related to this trend are Machine 
learning engineers, and AI Product managers, which are the highest paid in that 
field. A website you can utilize would be the learning site Udemy, along with The 
Berkely Artificial Intelligence Research. Another great resource would be w3 
schools. </p>

<article id="Renewable Energy">
<b><h2 class="Header">Renewable Energy  </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">Renewable Energy is When someone can use natural energy from the planet (Sun, 
Geothermal, Wind, etc.) to create cars and other devices without causing 
Carbon Dioxide to go into the planet's atmosphere. Renewable Energy creates job 
creation throughout renewable energy industries. It also allows for abundant, 
affordable, secure, safe, and clean energy, which is beneficial to humans.It may 
though generate toxic substances that may contaminate water resources. 
Renewable energy installations can also disrupt ecosystems and land use and may 
use significant amounts of water. Two componets of technology that is needed is 
Batteries and photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Some jobs in this trend include 
Greenhouse Worker, Recycling Worker, Environmental Technician, Urban Planner, 
Solar Installer, etc. One website that you can go to to learn more about 
Renewable Energy is Renewable Energy - Department of Energy (.gov)

<article id="Quantum Computing">
<b><h2 class="Header">Quantum Computing </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">Quantum computing, unlike classical computing, is built on Qubits rather than 
bits. While bits can store a value of one or zero, qubits can store both in any 
combination simultaneously – this is called a “superposition.” A single 
calculation leads to a single path in classical computing, but quantum computing 
can explore a massive number of different paths at the same time due to the 
volatility of the qubit. Quantum Computers can solve problems significantly faster 
than classical computers. In 2019, Google announced that a quantum computer solved 
a problem in 200 seconds (about 3 and a half minutes) that would take a normal 
computer 10,000 years. The vast number of solutions it can come up with can make 
it easier to develop models of molecules in the human body, accelerate the 
training of AI system, and do prime factorization. This can help the pharmaceutical
companies develop drugs, help the automotive companies teach self-driving cars 
how to make decisions in crucial moments, and factorize large prime numbers that 
businesses use as the basis for their encryption efforts. One of the main concerns 
with quantum computing is cybersecurity, especially in the event of large-scale 
quantum adoption. This means in the geopolitical space whoever gets their first 
has a huge advantage. Some quantum computers implement qubits using electronic 
states of charged atoms called ions. Trapped ion-based systems apply quantum gates 
using lasers to manipulate the electronic state of the ion. Some jobs in this 
buissness include Quantum Network Security Engineer, Quantum Systems Technician, 
Quantum Mechanics Developer, Quantum Hardware/Software Engineer. One website 
that you can go to to learn more about Quantum Computing is  
https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing </p>

<article id="AR and VR">
<b><h2 class="Header">AR and VR </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">AR- Augmented reality is an enhanced reality that uses text, graphics, and 
audio along with other enhanced integrated real- time objects. VR- Virtual reality 
is the use of computer modeling and simulation that allows a person to interact 
with an artifact that is three dimensional in a sensory environment. Some benifits 
to this Trend include AR allows Real-Time applications, AR Enhances Interactive 
learning, AR Increases of users' engagement, AR allows the Ability to provide a 
unique experience, VR allows Revolutionary Healthcare, it boosts creativity, and 
VR helps understand complex concepts. Concerns with VR are the headaches, nausea, 
and eyestrains caused when using for too long. Concerns with AR are the 
possibilities of physical harm, security and privacy issues, social issues. For 
AR you need a processor, input devices, sensors, & a display. For VR you need 
software, headset, audio system, input devices, sensors, processor. Some jobs 
in this career include Virtual Reality Engineer, Visual Systems Designer, AR/VR 
Camera Driver Engineer, AR/VR System Software Engineer, and a Performance 
Engineer. One site you can go to to learn more about this trend is Site. </p>

<article id="Cloud Computing">
<b><h2 class="Header">Cloud Computing </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">Simply put, Cloud computing is storing and accessing data and computing 
services over the internet rather than using local hard drives and personal data 
centers. The benefits to society from using Cloud Computing is getting their 
applications to market quickly. There are, or rather, lack thereof secure API’s. 
It is easy to access without authentication, which leads to vulnerability. 
The technology required for Cloud Computing is Client Infrastructure, Application, 
Service, Runtime Cloud, Storage, Infrastructure, Management, Security, and 
Internet. Some careers related to cloud computing are cloud administrator, 
cloud support engineer, cloud security analyst, cloud network engineer, 
cloud software engineer, and cloud automation engineer. One website that you could 
go to to help learn about Cloud Computing is What Is Cloud Computing? | Microsoft 
Azure </p>

<article id="Electric Vehicles">
<b><h2 class="Header">Electric Vehicles </h2></b>
<p class="Paragraph">Electric Vehicle also known as EV is a vehicle that can be powered by an 
electric motor which brings electricity from a battery and is capable of being 
charged from an external source. Using EV’s addresses an important public health 
hazard. They can also lower vehicle fueling costs by half, or more. EV battery 
production can adversely impact the environment, such as a loss of biodiversity, 
air pollution and decreased freshwater supply. Some of the componets of technology 
needed may include Head unit ECU, Electric Drivetrain, Electric Transmission, 
Motors, and Lithium Batteries. Some careers in this field are Electrical Engineer, 
Lithium Miner, Iron Miner, Welder, Software Engineer, Factory/Asembly line Manager,
Car Dealership Manager, Salesman, International affairs/sales Manager, and a 
Copper Miner. One important website for this topic is https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/. 
This is an important website because it is the California government site, so it's 
reliable information and California was the first state to implement mandatory 
electric vehicles laws. </p>
